% USAGE:
% metabList = fit_createMetabList;
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
% Creates a list of metabolite basis functions that are to be included in 
% a fit.
% 
% OUTPUTS:
% metabList = structure including flags (1 = included, 0 = excluded) for
%             each metabolite included in the FID-A spin system definition,
%             plus various MM basis functions that may have been included
%             with fit_makeBasis.
%
% INPUTS:
% NONE
