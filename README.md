# Osprey

Osprey is an all-in-one software suite for state-of-the art processing and
quantitative analysis of in-vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data.

### Features
- 1-file job definition system for reproducible data analysis
- Automated recognition of input file format and sequence origin
- Fully-automated loading and pre-processing pipeline for optimal SNR, linewidth, phasing, and alignment
- Integrated linear-combination modeling module
- Full density-matrix simulated basis sets (using real pulses and sequence timings; including effects of localization and spectral editing) for many metabolites and common sequence implementations
- Integrated voxel co-registration and segmentation module (requires SPM12)
- Quantification based on tissue fractions and (customizable) metabolite/tissue water relaxation times

### Supported methods
- Conventional MRS (STEAM, PRESS, semi-LASER, LASER)
- MEGA editing
- Hadamard-encoded editing (HERMES, HERCULES)

### Supported sequence implementations
- Philips (Johns Hopkins patches; Philips product sequences)
- Siemens (Johns Hopkins patches; Siemens WIP sequences; CMRR sequences; Jamie Near sequence)
- GE (Ralph Noeske sequence)

### Supported file formats
- Philips: SDAT/SPAR, DATA/LIST (coming soon), SIN/LAB/RAW (coming soon)
- Siemens: TWIX/DAT, RDA (single- & multi-file), DICOM (DCM/IMA, single- & multi-file)
- GE: P

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Osprey requires [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and
has been tested on version 2017a and newer. The following toolboxes are
required for full functionality:

- Image processing
- Optimization
- Signal Processing
- Statistics and Machine Learning
- Wavelet

### Installation

Download the latest **Osprey** code from its [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/schorschinho/osprey), then extract and add the
entire folder (with subfolders) to your MATLAB path. Make sure to regularly
check for updates, as we frequently commit new features, bug fixes, and improved
functions.

To perform voxel co-registration and tissue segmentation, download **SPM12**
[from the UCL website](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/), then
extract and add to your MATLAB path.
