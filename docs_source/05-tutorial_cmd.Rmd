# Osprey command line tutorial

All **Osprey** functions descibed in the GUI section can alternatively be called directly using a series of commands in the Matlab terminal. The function RunOspreyJob.m is a one-stop-shop wrapper for all of these commands, running the full analysis without interruption:

```octave
MRSCont = RunOspreyJob('Path/To/Job/File');
```

It may be preferable to view your analysis at each step by calling each command in turn. After setting up the job file, either as a Matlab .m file, .json, or .csv, the **Osprey** job is initialized as follows:

```octave
MRSCont = OspreyJob('Path/To/Job/File');
```
MRSCont will now contain the options and file locations for your data, as specified in the job file. Next, the data can be loaded:

```octave
MRSCont = OspreyLoad(MRSCont);
```

The substructure, MRSCont.raw, now contains the raw MRS data, as extracted from their native format. We may now preprocess these data:

```octave
MRSCont = OspreyProcess(MRSCont);
```

The MRSCont.processed will now contain the processed data, as well as some quality control measures in MRSCont.QM for your inspection. If all is well, we may now fit the data:

```octave
MRSCont = OspreyFit(MRSCont);
```

Modeling results are added to the MRSCont.fit, including results tables. If we have structural data, we can coregister our voxels, and perform tissue segmentation:

```octave
MRSCont = OspreyCoreg(MRSCont);
MRSCont = OspreySeg(MRSCont);
```

MRSCont now has sub-structures relating to voxel masks and volumes, MRSCont.coreg, and tissue segmentation results in MRSCont.seg.

Whether we had structural images or not, we may now quantify our spectra to produce some numerical results:

```octave
MRSCont = OspreyQuantify(MRSCont);
```

Finally, we may run the OspreyOverview function:

```octave
MRSCont = OspreyOverview(MRSCont);
```

This final function adds group measures, if we have a stat.csv file, and performs some statistics necesary for some of the plotting functions and GUI windows.

At any point during a command-line analysis, it is possible to visualize the data using the plot functions found in **Osprey/plot**, or even by switching to the GUI mid-analysis using:

```octave
OspreyGUI(MRSCont);
```
