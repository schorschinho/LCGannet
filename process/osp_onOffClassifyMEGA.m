function [outA, outB, switchOrder] = osp_onOffClassifyMEGA(inA, inB, target)
%% [outA, outB, switchOrder] = osp_onOffClassifyMEGA(inA, inB, target)
%   This function decides which of the two provided MEGA sub-spectra in the
%   are the edit-ON or the edit-OFF.
%
%   To this end, the difference spectrum is analyzed. For GABA-edited data,
%   the NAA peak is investigated; for GSH-edited data, the residual water
%   peak.
%
%   The function then assigns the edit-OFF spectrum to field A, and the
%   edit-ON spectrum to field B.
%
%   USAGE:
%       [outA, outB] = osp_onOffClassifyMEGA(inA, inB, target)
%
%   INPUTS:
%       inA     = FID-A structure containing one MEGA sub-spectrum.
%       inB     = FID-A structure containing the other MEGA sub-spectrum.
%       target  = String. Can be 'GABA' or 'GSH'.
%
%   OUTPUTS:
%       outA    = FID-A structure containing the edit-OFF MEGA sub-spectrum.
%       outB    = FID-A structure containing the edit-ON MEGA sub-spectrum.
%       switchOrder = Vector indicating the order in which the input
%               spectra are rearranged in order to generate the output order.
